The game has bugs:

- On Linux, the paddles aren't translucent... don't know why but it's basically a blocker

- Any OS, when the ball starts going warp speed (played by 2 AI's) the ball will disappear and nothing else will happen

Because of these bugs, I don't have binaries of this game available.
